\brief porting from \tcl86 back to \atl85 â†’ \ref atlsh
    
The porting of the first \tcl86 commands to \atl85 has been successfully completed.
The following commands have been ported: `try/catch/finally, throw, lsearch, lsort, lassign`...

\atl85 inherits the \c tests directory from \tcl86, ensuring that all "possible" \tcl86 commands
run identically under \atl85. The goal is maximum compatibility with an estimated \b 20% speed advantage
by eliminating the "dead end" of \NRE and \tclOO.
