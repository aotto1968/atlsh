\brief Create a massively parallel test environment that reduces **full** testing of @atlsh to less than 1 minute.
    
\par atltest
- @atltest is a wrapper around @atltest and primarily serves to provide the correct environment from  
  the *build* and *source* source, as well as an @automake-specific adjustment that affects the sequence of 
  \e test-option and \e test-case.
- Parallel testing under `make check` in `automake` requires the return code of a failed test.
  However, @atltest doesn't provide it, so `atltest.2.3.8` has been patched.
- A large number of files in the `tests` directory were parallelized, which was necessary because
  @TCL itself only supports \e sequential-testing.

\brief The goal of @atlsh is to replace @bash as the central tool for system programming 
and system control with an AI-based tool.
    
Start \ref atlsh by porting of the first \tcl86 commands to \atl85 has been successfully completed.
The following commands have been ported: `try/catch/finally, throw, lsearch, lsort, lassign`...

\atl85 inherits the \c tests directory from \tcl86, ensuring that all "possible" \tcl86 commands
run identically under \atl85. The goal is maximum compatibility with an estimated \b 20% speed advantage
by eliminating the "dead end" of \NRE and \tclOO.
