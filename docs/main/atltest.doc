\page atltest   atltest 
\brief  @atltest is a tool for testing the `*.test` files from the `theATL/tests` directory.

\tableofcontents

- The test file (`*.test`) from the `theATL/atlsh/tests` directory is mirrored to the `theATL/tests` directory via a soft link.
  - The @theATL test environment is created **without** changes to the @atlsh distribution.

- Massive parallel testing with the @automake `make check` was implemented in the `theATL/tests` directory.
  - An adaptation to the @atltest tool and the `*.test` files was required.

- The largest adaptation was made to the test cases (*.test) provided by @TCL.
  - By default, @TCL only supports sequential testing.
  - By default, @TCL uses the same **temporary** file name across different *test cases*.

# atltest {#atltest_tool}
@atltest is a wrapper around @atltest and primarily serves to provide the correct environment from  
the *build* and *source* directory, as well as an @automake-specific adjustment that affects the sequence of 
*test-option* and *test-case*.

# Makefile.am {#atltest_make}
@automake file to configure the local directory

# atlBuild.sh {#atltest_config}
The goal of `atlBuild.sh` is the same as for `atlConfig.sh` except that `atlBuild.sh` only configures 
the *build environment* - using only paths from the *build directory* or the *source directory*.
