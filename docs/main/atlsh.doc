\brief The new shell for system-administration and system-programming â€¦

@large{
\noop [atlsh-goal]
The goal of @atlsh is to replace @bash as the central tool for system programming 
and system control with an AI-based tool.
\noop [atlsh-goal]

\section atlsh-details  details

\noop [atlsh-details]
The @atlsh combines @theATL, @theKernel, @theLink, @theLib into one tool for @LINUX system administration.

- The @atl85 source distribution is available on @github and is the continuation of the @tcl85 development.
- Capabilities from @tcl86 will be gradually ported to @atl85 in order to get the maximum benefit from the 
  current @tcl86 development.
- The aim of @atlsh is to offer a **local** AI integration in order to provide the administrator and 
  the programmer with an environment that works **without** external dependencies.

\subsection update_8_mai_2025   update 8 mai 2025

- After switching from @tcl85 to @tcl86, it became apparent that there was a problem distinguishing an @b existing 
  @tcl86 installation from the new @atl10 installation. 
- To circumvent this and protect @tcl86, the distribution was renamed to @atl10, thus changing the @e visible interface 
  to @b atl. 
- The invisible interface (i.e., functions, variables, constants, etc.) remains untouched and thus binary compatible.
  - However, this will change in the future when \c atlsh becomes a standalone product.
- The following changes were made:

\subsection update_5_mai_2025   update 5 mai 2025

After switching from @tcl85 to @tcl86, the paralellization of @tcltest was complete.
- @zlib and @tclOO have also been removed.
- all \e sub-packages from \c pkgs were removed.
- Next, @NRE and @thread support will be removed.
- Once all this is complete, the @interp command will be replaced by a \b NEW technology.
- example: new massive parallel testing of the @tcl86 test suite.

\subsection update_2_mai_2025   update 2 mai 2025

- Testing @tcl85 with the @tcl86 test cases revealed that @tcl85 contains numerous serious (core) bugs that were only 
  fixed in @tcl86.
- However, @tcl86 is now the problematic version with @NRE and @tclOO. 
- An initial attempt to patch @tcl85 required importing a large amount of code from @tcl86. 
- This raises the question of whether it even makes sense to patch @tcl85 towards @tcl86 when the end result is @tcl86 anyway.
- The strategy of starting with @tcl86 and removing everything unwanted seems more sensible to me, as it starts with a 
  bug-free launch, which is then successively retested at each step.

\subsection update_25_apr_2025  update 25 apr 2025

- Splitting @atl85 from @tcl85 and porting all commands from @tcl86 to it.
- Integrating into @NHI10 with suspension of the \e build environment and definition of the \e directory structure.
- Updating the \e test cases to the \tcl86 standard with adoption of \atltest v2.5.3.
- The central goal is a \e lightweight shell that does not require \NRE or \tclOO.


\section atlsh-advanced  advanced modification

- Now that the @tcl86 level has been reached, @atlsh will be gradually expanded to include @theLib, which 
  provides fast and easy @OOP support.
- Then, the complete rebuild of @atlsh will begin with the integration of @theKernel and @theLink, which will involve 
  an architectural change focused on @LINUX fork and \e process-management.
