\brief the new shell for system-administration and system-programming â€¦

# goal

\noop [[atlsh-goal]]
The goal of @atlsh is to replace @bash as the central tool for system programming 
and system control with an AI-based tool.
\noop [[atlsh-goal]]

# details

\noop [atlsh-details]
The @atlsh combines @theATL, @theKernel, @theLink, @theLib into one tool for @LINUX system administration.

- The @atl85 source distribution is available on @github and is the continuation of the @tcl85 development.
- Capabilities from @tcl86 will be gradually ported to @atl85 in order to get the maximum benefit from the 
  current @tcl86 development.
- The aim of @atlsh is to offer a **local** AI integration in order to provide the administrator and 
  the programmer with an environment that works **without** external dependencies.
\noop [atlsh-details]

# roadmap

## initial setup

- Splitting @atl85 from @tcl85 and porting all commands from @tcl86 to it.
- Integrating into @NHI10 with suspension of the \e build environment and definition of the \e directory structure.
- Updating the \e test cases to the \tcl86 standard with adoption of \tcltest v2.5.3.
- The central goal is a \e lightweight shell that does not require \NRE or \tclOO.

## advanced modification

- Now that the @tcl86 level has been reached, @atlsh will be gradually expanded to include @theLib, which 
  provides fast and easy @OOP support.
- Then, the complete rebuild of @atlsh will begin with the integration of @theKernel and @theLink, which will involve 
  an architectural change focused on @LINUX fork and \e process-management.
