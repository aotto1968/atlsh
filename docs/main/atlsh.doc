# roadmap

> The central goal of @atlsh is to replace @bash as the central system programming tool for the @LINUX operating system.

## initial setup

- Splitting @atl85 from @tcl85 and porting all commands from @tcl86 to it.
- Integrating into @NHI10 with suspension of the \e build environment and definition of the \e directory structure.
- Updating the \e test cases to the \tcl86 standard with adoption of \tcltest v2.5.3.
- The central goal is a \e lightweight shell that does not require \NRE or \tclOO.

## advanced modification

- Now that the @tcl86 level has been reached, @atlsh will be gradually expanded to include @theLib, which 
  provides fast and easy @OOP support.
- Then, the complete rebuild of @atlsh will begin with the integration of @theKernel and @theLink, which will involve 
  an architectural change focused on @LINUX fork and \e process-management.

## development goal

- The end result of the development will be an AI operating system based on \theKernel, \theLink, \theLib and \theATL.
